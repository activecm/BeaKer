This script generates an installer for BeaKer.
The resulting file is not intended to be installed directly by customers.
Usage:
  ${_NAME} [<arguments>]
Options:
  -h|--help     Show this help message.
  --use-cache   Builds Docker images using the local cache.
  --no-pull     Do not pull the latest base images from the container
                repository during the build process.
  --no-build    Do not build Docker images from scratch. This requires
                you to have the images already built on your system. (Implies --no-pull)
